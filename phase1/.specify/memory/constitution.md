# Todo In-Memory Python Console App Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-Driven Development
Every line of code must be generated by Claude Code from refined Markdown specifications. No manual coding is allowed. This ensures traceability, consistency, and reproducibility of the development process.

### II. Clean Architecture
Separate concerns clearly (models, storage, business logic, CLI interface) to enable smooth evolution in later phases. Maintain clear boundaries between different layers of the application to support future extensibility.

### III. Simplicity and Readability
Prioritize straightforward, idiomatic Python code that is easy to understand and extend. Use meaningful variable/function names, comprehensive docstrings, and type hints for public interfaces to enhance maintainability.

### IV. Reliability and User Experience
Implement graceful handling of user input, clear feedback, and robust error management in the console. Ensure the application provides helpful error messages and intuitive user interactions.

### V. Future-Proof Design
Structure the code and project layout to support seamless progression to web, database, AI agents, and cloud-native phases. Design with extensibility in mind while maintaining current functionality.

### VI. Standard Library Only

Use Python standard library only for core functionality (no external packages required). This ensures portability, reduces dependencies, and simplifies deployment and maintenance.

## Technology Standards
Language and Style: Python 3.13+, strict adherence to PEP 8, meaningful variable/function names, comprehensive docstrings, and type hints for public interfaces. Maintain consistent coding standards across all modules.

## Task Model and Features
Each task must have auto-incremented integer ID, title (required string), description (optional string), and completed status (boolean, default False). Implement exactly the 5 basic features – Add Task, Delete Task, Update Task, View Task List, Mark as Complete. Support command-loop with clear menu or command-based input supporting: add, list, update <id>, delete <id>, complete <id>, exit.

## Governance
This constitution supersedes all other practices. All development must comply with these principles. Amendments require documentation, approval, and appropriate migration plan. All code reviews must verify compliance with these principles.

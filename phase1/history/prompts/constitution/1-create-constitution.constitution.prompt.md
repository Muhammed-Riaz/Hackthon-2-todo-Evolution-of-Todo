## Prompt

```
/sp.constituion /sp.constitution

Project: Todo In-Memory Python Console App (Phase I - Evolution of Todo Hackathon)

Core principles:
- Spec-Driven Development: Every line of code must be generated by Claude Code from refined Markdown specifications. No manual coding is allowed.
- Clean Architecture: Separate concerns clearly (models, storage, business logic, CLI interface) to enable smooth evolution in later phases.
- Simplicity and Readability: Prioritize straightforward, idiomatic Python code that is easy to understand and extend.
- Reliability and User Experience: Graceful handling of user input, clear feedback, and robust error management in the console.
- Future-Proof Design: Structure the code and project layout to support seamless progression to web, database, AI agents, and cloud-native phases.

Key standards:
- Language and Style: Python 3.13+, strict adherence to PEP 8, meaningful variable/function names, comprehensive docstrings, and type hints for public interfaces.
- Task Model: Each task must have auto-incremented integer ID, title (required string), description (optional string), and completed status (boolean, default False).
- Storage: In-memory only using a simple list or manager class – no files or databases.
- CLI Interface: Command-loop with clear menu or command-based input supporting: add, list, update <id>, delete <id>, complete <id>, exit.
- Project Structure: Root contains constitution.md, specs/ folder (with numbered spec files and iteration history), src/ folder (with __init__.py, models.py, todo_manager.py, cli.py, main.py), README.md, and CLAUDE.md.
- Dependencies: Standard library only for core functionality (no external packages required).

Constraints:
- Features: Implement exactly the 5 basic features – Add Task, Delete Task, Update Task, View Task List, Mark as Complete.
- No Persistence: Data is lost on exit.
- Input Validation: Handle invalid IDs, empty titles, and malformed commands gracefully.
- Testing/Demo: Include example usage in README.md and ensure the app runs cleanly with sampl[Request interrupted by user]

## Response snapshot

Created the constitution file at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` with the following principles:
- Spec-Driven Development: Every line of code must be generated by Claude Code from refined Markdown specifications. No manual coding is allowed.
- Clean Architecture: Separate concerns clearly (models, storage, business logic, CLI interface) to enable smooth evolution in later phases.
- Simplicity and Readability: Prioritize straightforward, idiomatic Python code that is easy to understand and extend.
- Reliability and User Experience: Implement graceful handling of user input, clear feedback, and robust error management in the console.
- Future-Proof Design: Structure the code and project layout to support seamless progression to web, database, AI agents, and cloud-native phases.
- Standard Library Only: Use Python standard library only for core functionality (no external packages required).

Also included technology standards, task model and features requirements, and governance section.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created foundational governance document for the project
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: Updated .specify/memory/constitution.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Can proceed with spec creation and project implementation
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution provides clear principles and constraints for the todo app development
